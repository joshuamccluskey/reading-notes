#### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team- Charles Duhigg

- Basically researchers can't find one reason why a group is successful. You can take the same people and place them in very simiilar groups and they can find success and failure.

Psychological saftey according to the article:

"...‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’

- Overall the thing that is important is that we have to remember that we are all human. It's difficult to quantify what we feel and how that shapes the success of a group. It's the abiulity to empathize and communicate that will allow the group to better work together. We all of have emotions and feelings and we hall have a preception of how things are in a group.The more sensitive a group is to how the overall  feeling and emotion is the better it will be able communicat and accomplish a task.
