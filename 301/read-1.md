## Read Class 01

### Joshua McCluskey

### What is a “component”?

- Object Oriented View: A component is a set fo one or more working classses. Problem domain classs and infastructure class to identify all attributes and operations. Classes communicate and work together
- Conventional view: A modular or functional element that can be integrated into it to process logic
- Process related view: Insteadf of building from scratch it uses compeonents already built in the libraries

### What are the characteristics of a component?

- Reuseable
- Replaceable
- Nost Context Specific
- Extensible
- Encapsulated
- Independent
- Modular
- portable
- A software object interacting with other components and encapsulating other funcionalities
- Can be deployed and subject to other dependencies

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Lower development costs using already built components and quicker build times
- Reliable when usiing exisiting compnenets as opposed to building everything from scratch.
- Ease of Deployment
- Reduced Costs
- Ease of Development
- Reusable
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

### What is “props” short for?

- Short for properties

### How are props used in React?

- They are used to pass data from one componenet to another and are read-only.

### What is the flow of props?

- They are passed in a uni-directinal flow

- Props are passed to compenents like a function argument
- Props can only be passed onee way from parent to child
- Props data is immutable meaning readonly.
