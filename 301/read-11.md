# Mongo and Mongoose

## Read Class 11

### Joshua McCluskey

### SQL

- Relational Database Managemenet System RDBMS
- Table with rows of data
- Vetically Scalable - more powerful hardware to scale RAM, CPU, SSD
- MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
- Complex qureries
- Great support
- ACID Properties

### NoSQL

- Document Based
- Key value paired
- Horizontally Scalable - More Server needed for scale
- MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
- Not great for complex queries
- Community support
- Brewers CAP theorem

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

A database that requires complex quereies and requires data to structured in tables and rows and vertical scalibility.

### Give a real world example

Financial information that is traditionally stored in a table format.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

A database that requiresless complex quereies and requires data to structured in documents in key valued pairs

### Give a real world examples

A filing system where information needs to retrieved from a specific document or form with various unique information.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL is better since it uses key-value pairs Best for BIG data.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL since you would add more servers to support your scale.

### What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Lanagage

### What is a relational database?

It works with assumptions and uses SQL and uses tables. It's like a database containter.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A business inventory that has text and numbers associated with a row.

Profile information.

### What is a ‘schema’?

It is a definition of which data can go into our fields. It must follow the structure and fits the format of the table. You work with multiple tables that are realated like seperate profile information.

### What is a NoSQL database?

MongoDB comes from the  word humungous since it used to store lots and lots of data.

### How does it work?

Instead of tables we have collections and within collections there are documents that are key vlaued pairs with no schema

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

It has documents that cantaing key value pairs. A document can have various types of data that all need to be organized in one place.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

MongoDb is more flexible. If your not sure you ahve all the information and can be more flexible in the data format. No relations. Where you would put all the information with varius data types into one place. It has faster queries

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database

It is schemaless and no realtions depending on what you need to do.
