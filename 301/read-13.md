### Statistics of women in Computer Science

#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

In 1984, the number of women in the computer science field flattned and declined while other professions saw adrastic increase in women gravitating towards. It can be contributed to the rise of the personal computer. Perosnal computers and video games were marked for men and boys. Prior to the 1980s there was no expectation of prior experience working with computers. It's a male dominated career field that control so much of the industry. Societies view on who should be using a computer in the house it was for boys.

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

If there's expectation or standard going into a program with prior experience for course, it puts others that are not males or who didn't grow up with computers at a disadvantage. It built a societal norm that really didin't make any sense, but fell on gender stereotypes and roles.

Overall, it comes down to privilige. When males grow with playing with computers, they are placed at an advantage over those who dont have that privlige who can't afford a computer or are told they can't use a computer based on whether or not they are a male.

### When are diversity efforts most successful?

When company leaders are driven and show taht they are commited to diversity efforts. They just can't show but they must have adeep understaing why it is important.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Performance in a company is better with mroe diversity. Where some research shows an increase in revenue when women are in top level mangement roles. You can tackle problems and view problems in from many different angles when you have more diversity. Diveristy leads to more revenue and a business that is not active in diversity efforts is losing out on profit potential.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa

Represenation is important. Hollywood is a highly underrepresented in Asian American voices and idnetity. As more and more people, brought awareness to this, there was a noticable shift in effort by the biggest production companies in Hollywood to have more representation and stories and cultures represented in movies. By understanding diversity, Hollywood was able to elevate the voice and identity but it is still lacking representation. As more people of color move into this industry there will be more advocates for diversity oand change.
