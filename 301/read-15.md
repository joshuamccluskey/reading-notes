# Authentication

## Read Class 15

### Joshua McCluskey

#### Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

You would use PUT to update a record through an API.

#### Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

DELETE and PUT both would need an ID.

- We can bring this all together to make an account and login process, but at first glance I would still be cautious of security.

#### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

From my understanding after reading and seeing it few times now. CRUD is a way to remember what you need to do when creating an API. Create, Read, Update, Delete. Those would translate into using REST: `.post() .get() .put() .delete()`

#### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

The 5 most basic process would be:

1. Use `.post()` to Create
2. Use `.get()` to Read
3. Use `.put()` to Update
4. Use `.delete()` tp Delete
5. Use a REST Client like Thunder Client to test and see if it the abovce 4 are working and functioning.

#### Thngs I want to learn mroe about

I want to learn more about OAuth and Auth0, and I thought they were the same thing for authentication, but maybe not.
