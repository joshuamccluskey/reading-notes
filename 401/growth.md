## Notes

### Joshua McCluskey

#### Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

- Push yourself outside your comfort zone
- Do the things you know you need to work on
- Constantly challenge yourself

#### The power of believing that you can improve

According to Dr. Carol Dweck, changing the mindset from a failure to a growth mindset improves and motivates on what an inidvidual can achieve. Not yet, is an important part of growth mindset and changing how we think when something takes more effort and time. Whenever something that may take more time to understand remember your're not failing, your changing your mindset to a more postiive approach that will try to improve and develop by telling yourself and believeing in yourself by saying not yet.

#### Grit: The power of passion and perseverance

According to Dr. Angela Lee Duckworth, it's not the smartest or the most talented that are the strongest. The individuals that have grit that can achieve more and succeed. Talented people are not gritty, the individuals that have a growth mindeset and are those that have the most grit. Motivation and effort over the long term are the reciepes for grit and achieving more in the long run.

#### A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

Accoridng to Dr. Alain de Botton, modern society has determined what success means, but poses to us what does success really mean to each one of us. In sum, don't compare yourself to other people and be envious. Don't have your self worth be your job or position, but if that is important to you then know what you are missing out on or losing. The part of the his talk that resonated with me are the things that don't remind us of anything in our society and nature. I think that is why I'm so drawn to rock climbing and snowboarding becuase it brings me closer to nature and away from the noise and madness that society dictates as success.
