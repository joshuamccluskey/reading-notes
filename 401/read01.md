#### Java 101

- In java variables are declared based on values datatype ex. `int num = 1;`
- You can manipulate the scoping more with static and non static fields
- Primitives:
- byte - 8 bit complement int; useful in saving memory in large arrays
- short - 16 bit complement int; same as byte saves memory in large arrays
- int - integer 32 bit
- long - complements int 64 bit
- float -  decimal numbers 32 bit use to save memory instead of using double
- double - decimal numbers 64 bit
- boolean - true / false
- char - a single 16 bit unicode character
- All have default values of false, null, or 0
- Literals when you declare variable with value
- Arrays need to be declared with its size
- Java has all the arithmitic, realtional, and equality, conditional operators familar with in other languages
- Java has ternary syntax conditional
- Switch statements will need more practice

#### Compile Code

Java needs a compiler to take what we wrote to understand as a human and compile it or translate it for the computer into 1s and 0s in order for the computer to understand what we wrote. Languages like Java and C# need a compiler.
