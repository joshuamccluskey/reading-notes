### Packages and imports

- Package declaration happpens at the top before imports
- Imports happen below the package statement
- You can ust the wild card symbol `*` to import all classes
- Importing classes doesn't make your file larger
- It is not less efficent to import all the classes'
- It makes it hard to read when explicitly import all the classes
- Explicity importing also may have obsolete imports that are no longer used
- Using a wild card only makes classes visible not the subclasses
- You don't need to import System of String
- Make them easier to read
