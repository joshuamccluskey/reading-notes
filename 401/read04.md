## Classes 

- Classes work like they did in React. You have a class and then you can extend the class with subclasses.
- You can now access all the information with the orginal class but keep unique properties in the subclass.

```Java
//class declarations
class SecondClass (String movie1, String meal1, int space1) {
  movie = movie1;
  meal = meal1;
  space = space 1
    
}

class SecondClass extends FirstClass implements YourAmenities {
    
}

//You can use modifiers
//Capitalize Class names
// Extend parent class
//Sperate multiple interfaces with comma on the 
```
- use parameters to pass information to class constructors and methods
## Object
- All objects have state and behavior
- Think about all the characteristics of your dog
- data encapsulation hide internal state and all inactions via object's methods
Advantages:
- Modularity
- Information-hiding
- Code re-use
- Pluggability 

Objects have 3 parts:
- Declarations
- Instantiation : `new` keyword important
- Initialization : `new` Keyword important


- Use `return` when you need to return a value from method
- Use `this` within the instance of constructor class

## Decimals

### Base10
- Base 10 uses the 10 numerical characters 0-9

### Binary
- Base 2 meaning only using characters 0-1

### Hexadecimal
- Use all Base 10 characters 0-9 but also use the first 6 characters of Alphabet A-F
