# OO Design 

- YAGNI: 
  - You aren't gonna need it - Don't add functionality until it is needed. Do it as you need them.
- Rule of three: 
  - A refactoring tenet when you see the same code twice, it's fine, but when you seee it three times you should refactor it into one.
- DRY: 
  - Don't repeat yourself- try not to repeat yourself. 
  - Other renditions of DRY are WET - write everything twice or  wastes everyone's time and AHA Avoid Hasty Abstractions
- Minimum Viable Product or MVP - 
  - is the version that just meets the most basic requirements. This allows developers to avoid unnecessary work. 
  - A concept at the intersection of business and development
  - A concept to test and release early to customers to get feedback with the least money spent and develop from the feedback
  - Release early and release often which puts the users at the center of feedback and development
    - CANVAS
    - Customers- Do the customers actually want the product or need it
    - Value Proposition- What problem does it solve is there in any value in the product
    - Channels - MVP would look at new channels of delivery and to see if it brings any value to the customer
    - Relationship -  Maintaining a relationship with the customer making them feel valued while maintaining an MVP and not sacrificing reputation and costs.
