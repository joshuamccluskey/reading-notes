- Andoird app languages : Kotlin, Java, C++
- .apk is the suffix for an android package
- .aab is the suffix for an android bundle
- android OS is an multi user Linux system each app is a different user
- Each app is assigned a new user id
- Each app runs on its own VM
- Apps can have the same user ID to share files and signed with the same cert

### App components

- 4 types of App Components:

- Activities - an entry point for interacting with user
- Services - is a general purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background
- Bound services run because some other app (or the system)
- Broadcast receivers
- Content Providers - manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system

### Activating Components

- Activities, services, broadcasts receivers are activated asynchronously message called intent

### Manifest File

- AndroidManifest.xml
- All components must be declared in the manifest file
- <activity> elements for activities.
- <service> elements for services.
- <receiver> elements for broadcast receivers.
- <provider> elements for content providers.

````Java
//Example of intent and activity
<manifest ... >

            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
</application>
</manifest>

### Declaring App Requirements

- Values for minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are set in your app module's build.gradle file
````Java
android {

  defaultConfig {
    ...
    minSdkVersion 26
    targetSdkVersion 29
  }
}

<manifest ... >
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.any"
