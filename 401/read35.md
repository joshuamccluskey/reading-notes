# Graphs

## Read 35

### Joshua McCluskey

- Graphs are anon linear data structure that has a collection of vertices and edges.
- Vertex can also be called a  node that can have multiple vertices
- Edige is connection between the nodes
- Neighbor are nodes next to each other
- Degree number of edges to a specific node.


#### Directed vs. Undirected

- An unidrected graph is a graph where the edges are undriected or bi directions meaning there isn't an apparent direction in
to the graph.
- Directed graph is a graph where every edge is directed

#### Connected, Complete, Disconnected

- Complete is when all nodes are connected to each other
- Connected is when all nodes have at least one vertex
- Disconnected is some nodes may not have any edges

#### Acyclic Graph  abd Cyclic Graphs

- Directed graph without cycles
- A Cycle is when a traverse can happen and end back at the same nade it started
- A cyclic graph is one where it can start and end at the same vertex.

#### Adjacency Matrix and List
- Adjacency Matrix is represented as a 2d array
- Adjacency list is the common way to represent graphs

#### Weighted Graphs
- a graph with numbers assigned to its edges.
- if there is no connection between verticeies then a 0 is used

#### Traversals

- Breadth First Search like a tree but when dealing with cycles
- So you must take into account whether a node has been visited before
