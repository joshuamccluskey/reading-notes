#### BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT

I think overall, it is important to note that this article does a great job of bringing up the issue
, but not much more than skimming the surface that data collection can lead to racist practices that in turn make Big Data a
Civil Rights Issue. It gives the reader the bare minimum information to formulate an opinion and add to this conversation.
When we think about the data that is being collected about us, the first thing
that comes to mind is that it is being used for marketing and advertisements. At first glance that seems
harmless, but when you realize that your data is being collected and sold to other entities that 
then use it in ways to monitor or manipulate society, it becomes disturbing. Category types are created
based on your where you live, what you buy, and how old you are, and I'm probably categorized
into a category of 30-somethings that likes local craft beers. Let's take that a step further and 
look at how a political campaigns could use data about users, and they start targeting adds based on your race and education 
and location. Or how it is known that some agencies are circumventing the red tape set in place from collecting
data from its own citizens by purchasing the data from a third party broker. When you are categorized and profiled you 
will be manipulated in the virtual space. When we start to look at people in terms of data and not the unique 
characteristics that make us unique humans, and condensed down to category used in profiling us in order to control us or
manipulate our  decision-making or the outcomes of our opportunities is when it becomes imperative that we move forward to 
making sure data is being used and collected responsibly. It's a civil rights issue that no one cares about until it's 
like a major presidential election and realize something is wierd is going on in my ads while I browse social media. Politicians 
are so out of touch from this issue and understanding it, and only call congressional hearings when it directly affects their 
personal campaigns and careers rater than protecting the privacy and interest of the citizens that they represent. This is the 
way I see it, and this is not intended as a political commentary.

#### The code I’m still ashamed of 

This is a pretty powerful and personal story of a developer that created a feature for a drug company that created
an online quiz advertisement that recommended the drug is every circumstance except for allergic reactions. First off, the
entire side of commercializing health care and drugs is problematic, and I want to shine light on it: Recently a doctor created some satire
on how they were calling into get approval for treatment their patient  needed, and the decision
on this treatment was determined by a nonmedical professional that never went to med school saying that the treatment can't be approved. Anyways, the focus on
the ethical dilemmas of a software engineer. I mention the above example because there were many people involved in the process prior 
to this software engineer making this quiz that recommended this drug to its users. A doctor had to prescribe and order it 
for the patient. The ethical burden shouldn't lie with the software engineer entirely. I think it is important as developers
that we question practices within industries that are designed to manipulate or harm people. When we fail to do the right thing, all the people
involved failed to do the right thing. The burden shouldn't fall on one person as a single point of failure. However, it takes just one person
in these moments to take the lead and say something is wrong and to speak up. The person in the article knew something was off
and still went to a steak dinner following some tragic news, which is ethically questionable knowing the information 
that you know but were still fine to go wine and dine with people who have no compass in this matter. However, it is important 
to get these lessons learned from others that way we as a whole community work harder to not repeat incidents like this. For that, it's important
to keep the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in mind going forward.
