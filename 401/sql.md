# SQL

## Notes

### Joshua McCluskey

In order for me to conceptualize and understand SQL and relational databases is to think of them in the context of an Excel workbook. SQL goes further as a powerful tool that go beyond the capacity of an Excel workbook and manipulate data. When you need to harness Big Data that and manipulate data at a large scale. We can perform queries via SQL to perform large scal data manipulation.
