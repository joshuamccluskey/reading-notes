# Terminal

## Notes

### Joshua McCluskey

Command notes:

'''Command
~ - for home directory
. - current directory
\ - escape character
man command - gets you the manual for the command
man -k search term - keyword search
/term - search for term in directory
'''

My biggest realization is that I should use the manual pages more often to learn more about my options in the terminal. I plan on using the above commands in my daily use of the terminal. After this course, I want to spend more time on Linux machine rather than my Mac. I think I may get a Raspberry Pi and play around with it and really push my "command" of the terminal. I think it would be a great way to push myself while having fun with small projects on the Raspberry Pi. Overall, it was great to learn and spark more curiosity into the terminal.
