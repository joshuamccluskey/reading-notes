I am Josh. I'm an Air Force vet that is growing and developing into software engineer. I love breaking down and learning foreign languages, and my skills translate well in the tech industry. It was after continuing my career in the federal government that I found inefficencies that could be automated and eliminated with technology. I want to make my world better.
