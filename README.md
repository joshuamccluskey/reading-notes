### Joshua McCluskey

I'm Josh, and I'm an Air Force vet that is growing and developing into a software engineer. I love breaking down and learning foreign languages, and my skills translate well in the tech industry. During my career in the federal government, I found inefficencies that could be automated and eliminated with technology in order to save time and taxpayer dollars. I want to help as many people around me through using technology.
