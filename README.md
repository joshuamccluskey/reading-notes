### Joshua McCluskey

I'm Josh, and I'm an Air Force vet that is growing and developing into a software engineer. I love breaking down and learning foreign languages, and my skills translate well in the tech industry. During my career in the federal government, I found inefficiencies that could be automated and eliminated with technology in order to save time and taxpayer dollars. I want to help as many people around me through using technology.

### My Growth Mindset Mottos

- Keep a positive attitude and progress
- Be disciplined, persistent, and consistent
- Stay humble and adapt
- Failing ~~isn't~~ __is__ amazing; embrace it and grow from it

#### Thoughts Growth Mindset

**Stay true to yourself**, but be open to the environment that is around you. **Progress is not easy**, and it'll test you. **Keep looking up and ahead**, and use `git add` ; `git commit` ; `git push`.  *Be disciplined, persistent, and consistent*, progress never happened without adaptation. Failing is truly a gift, celebrate it and grow.
