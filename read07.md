#### Control Flow

- Control flow is the order a script is executed.
- Conditionals or loops can change the order of execution.
- `if...else` statement is a conditional structure that executes based on the condition set

```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```

- Scripts in Javascript or PHP: conditionals, loops, functions, and execute based event
- control flow means that start to finish and looking at the whole program structure.

#### Epressions and Operators

`>=`
`<`
`<=`

###### Comparison Operators:

- `==` Compares two values
- `!=` **NOT** equal to 
- `===` strict equal
- `!==` strict __NOT__ equal 

###### Like in math
- `>`
- `>=`
- `<`
- `<=`

##### Logical Operators:
`&&` Logical AND
`||` Logical OR
`!` Logical NOT

##### Strings and Concantenation:

- Combines strings and variables using `+`

##### Conditional ternary operator

`condition ? val1 : val2`

Example:

`var status = (age >= 18) ? 'adult' : 'minor';`

- `typeof` gives you datatype
- `delete` removes property

##### Expression
